<h3 style="text-align:center;"> The user will be able to calculate the answers to simple physics and chemistry problems</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">   </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Will use python functions to calculate answers to problems based on the user's needs </h3>

<p style="text-align:center;">   </p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> Create a graph of a component vs. time or distance</h4>

    Originally MatterStick was going to be able to identify what type of problem was to be solved based of the variables.
    I decided to change that when I realized it would be better to have the user select what type of problem they want to
    have solved. Originally I also wanted there to be graphs and images representing visually what each problem looks like,
    however that proved to be more challenging than anticipated so I used the graph to represent a sample problem for
    problem 3, where an object is thrown off of a cliff. If there were more time I would have made a graph to represent each,
    specific calculation that user inputted. I also would have included different colors for each of these graphs so that they
    are unique to each problem. Additionally, in the future I would add several different types of more complex problems, such
    as using calculus to solve these types of problems and including more challenging problems.</p>
